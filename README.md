# 📡 WiFi Jamming Detector

This project uses an **ESP8266** microcontroller to detect WiFi deauthentication (and disassociation) packets — often signs of an attempted WiFi attack. When an attack is detected, the system activates a **buzzer**, **LED**, and displays information on an **OLED screen**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📶 Channel Scanning**: Monitors specific WiFi channels for deauth and disassoc frames.
- **🚨 Attack Detection**: Triggers alerts when a threshold of deauth packets is met.
- **📺 OLED Display**: Shows detection status and packet count.
- **🔊 Audible Alerts**: Buzzer beeps when an attack is detected.
- **💡 LED Indicator**: LED lights up during attack.
